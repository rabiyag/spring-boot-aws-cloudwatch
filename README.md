# Spring Boot AWS CloudWatch

This project demonstrates how to integrate AWS CloudWatch with a Spring Boot application for logging and monitoring. It uses CloudWatch Logs to centralize application logs and CloudWatch Metrics to monitor the performance and health of the application.

## Features
- AWS CloudWatch Logs Integration: Automatically sends application logs to CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging and analysis.
- Custom CloudWatch Metrics: Pushes custom metrics to CloudWatch to track application performance and other key metrics.
- Spring Boot Integration: Easy configuration and management with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud AWS.
- CloudWatch Dashboard: Create CloudWatch dashboards to visualize application logs and metrics in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** (Backend framework)
- **AWS Cloudwatch** (AWS Services)
- **Maven** (Dependency management)

## Prerequisites
- **JDK 8** or higher
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **AWS account**
